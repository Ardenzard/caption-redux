# Caption Generator
(lite)

a gif captioner in the ifunny caption style, popular on discord and r/whenthe

**heavly inspired by and features many snippets from [kubinka0505's iFunny-Captions](https://github.com/kubinka0505/iFunny-Captions)** (discontinued)


the above mentioned generator is far more advanced and currently better than this one
one small issue tho, its unmaintained, deprecated, and its code is hard to read

this project focuses on an easier to use and maintain version of the now archived repo

## plans:
- png captions
- png optimization
- video caption
- video optimization
- emoji support
- font, color, and emoji host configuration
- discord emoji support
- fancier cli
- gui
- cache system
- being able to process multiple captions at once
- wider range of supported gif hosting sites
