# Caption Generator
(lite)

a gif captioner in the ifunny caption style, popular on discord and r/whenthe

**heavly inspired by and features many snippets from [kubinka0505's iFunny-Captions](https://github.com/kubinka0505/iFunny-Captions)** (discontinued)


the above mentioned generator is far more advanced and currently better than this one
one small issue tho, its unmaintained, deprecated, and its code is hard to read

this project focuses on an easier to use and maintain version of the now archived repo

## usage
a more detailed usage coming soon
for advanced users: 
- add these to the path
    - ffmpeg
    - gifsicle
- install missing python packages (newest should work)
 

## plans:
- exception handling
- png optimization
- video caption
- video optimization
- font, color, and emoji host configuration
- fancier cli
- gui
- cache system
- wider range of supported gif hosting sites
- option to resize the gif to match the caption width and not the other way around
- requirements.txt
- try to use memory instead of much priceous ssd (stupit)
- size compression before/after, warn if its above 25mb
- loading bar
- figure out why halo and tqdm dont work -w-
- make it retain the original gif speed
- emoji styles
- force empty emoji cache
- foce gif output
- gif optimization options
